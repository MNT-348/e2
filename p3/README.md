## Notes for Instructor:
+ This project wasn't difficult to comprehend per se, but there's a lot of linked concepts/ideas that were intimidating purely from personal lack of experience. Expansion from the basics was a personal block.
+ For the life of me I couldn't correctly implement the functionality of starting the game with allowing the player to choose a coin pool (i.e. starting with 3, 5, or 10 coins), and whether they wanted to play as Odds/Evens in the game.
    - I tried keeping that within the 'index()' and 'process()' methods, but it wouldn't work (I kept getting some sort of error, especially with the 'choice' variable validation.)
+ I feel I could have worked out a different way of storing "rounds" as complete games, but I wasn't sure on quite how to organize that with the database and project requirements.
    - I acknowledge that I could have asked but I was working too close to the deadline...
+ I enjoyed your course immensely for its clairty and structure, but as a **private** note to you, I'm completely burnt out from taking CS50 concurrently this semester (even if it's been over for a week). 
    - There's a lot I wanted to do with this project that I just couldn't from personal mental fatigue.

## Codeception Testing Output:
