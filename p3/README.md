## Notes for instructor
+ I struggled with the layout and planning of this project; it wasn't difficult to comprehend per se, but there's a lot of linked concepts/ideas that were intimidating purely from personal lack of experience. Expansion from the basics was a personal block.
+ I enjoyed your course immensely, but as a private note to you, I'm completely burnt out from taking CS50 concurrently (even if it's been over for a week). There's a lot I wanted to do with this project that I just couldn't from personal mental fatigue.

## Codeception testing output
- N/a (undergraduate credit)
