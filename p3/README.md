## Notes for Instructor:
+ This project wasn't difficult to comprehend per se, but there's a lot of linked concepts/ideas in its architecture and design that were intimidating purely from personal lack of experience. Expansion from the basics was a personal block. 
    -I'm glad it's done with now at least, and after I finished, it made a lot more sense (Zipfoods was also excellent as a primer, but it was so lengthy in terms of time, I didn't conceptualize all of it well until P3's completion.)
+ For the life of me I couldn't correctly implement the functionality of starting the game with allowing the player to choose a coin pool (i.e. starting with 3, 5, or 10 coins), and whether they wanted to play as Odds/Evens in the game.
    - I tried keeping the functionality within the 'index()' and 'process()' methods, but it wouldn't work (I kept getting some sort of error, especially with the 'choice' variable validation). Perhaps this is where I went wrong in hindsight, but I didn't want to risk missing the project deadline and instead focused on less ambitiously getting a minimum viable product.
+ I feel I could have worked out a different way of storing "rounds" as complete games, but I wasn't sure on quite how to organize that with the database and project requirements in a sensible and useful manner.
    - I acknowledge that I could have asked but I was working too close to the deadline...
+ I enjoyed your course immensely for its clarity and structure, but as a **private** note to you, I'm truly burnt out from taking CS50 concurrently this semester. 
    - There's a lot I wanted to do with this project that I just couldn't from personal mental fatigue.
    - This course made HTML, CSS, and integrating it with other functional languages (e.g. PHP here, Python/JS otherwise) so much easier to comprehend in terms of how to design a web application and integrate further functionality (OOP theory especially).
+ Closing Note: My final project admittedly isn't 100% what I was aiming for in what I wanted to do, but as a programming beginner, I'm very, very glad I took your course overall. It's given me far more in terms of coding understanding than just with web design; it's actually a great CS course in and of itself. 
    - I can't take the sequel course immediately due to lack of funding at the moment, but hope to if it's offered later in 2024. Thank you for everything!
