## Notes for instructor
+ Minimum viable product for P2 was goal; I was short on time to work on P2 due to being very ill the past week.
+ I was having a lot of trouble trying to implement extra functions (such as the ability for the player to choose to play Evens or Odds, and a per-round ante of an extra coin to win/lose once the player chose a coin face). Managing the flow of information from the `process.php` and `index.php` pages still is complicated for me on where is it best to put what data (particularly conditionals) and in what form.
+ I'm personally dissatisfied with what I have so far, but I'd like to continue to refine it in the future to have the added functionality I originally intended when brainstorming in P1.
